## My First Hand-in Project 
-Building a website for people who love Autumn.

## Combining Bootstrap with HTML & Css
- This has been a very challenging project.

## Love of this time of the year.
- I love the Autumn and Halloween season so I decided to make a website for like minded people to come together.
